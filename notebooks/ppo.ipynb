    "# PPO Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a simple example of using the environment as a gym environment and training a PPO agent on it. Here we use the [CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/blob/master/cleanrl/ppo.py) implementation of PPO to test our environment. You can see that the agent is able to successfully solve the environment with over 14K SPS on a M3 Macbook. \n",

    "In order to use this, we have to wrap the C src environment in an a Gymnasium `Env` class. This allows us to easily integrate into the PPO agent. "
